## DEPRECATED FEATURES OF *ELPA* ##

This file contains a list of features, which have been replaced by other options.
Thus these features are considered as deprecated, and will be removed at some point
in the (near) future from the *ELPA* library.

### A) Deprecated interfaces:###

With the release of ELPA 2017.05.001 a new, more general API for the library has
been published. All new features of ELPA will only be accesible via this new interface.
For ease of transion, the API as defined in release ELPA 2016.11.001 has been frozen in
and will be still supported for some time, albeit without any new features.

Independent of the freezing in of the old, legacy API from the release 2016.11.001 the
following listed interfaces will be removed at some time.

In order to unfiy the namespace of the *ELPA* public interfaces, several interfaces
have been replaced by new names. The old interfaces will be removed

For all symbols also the corresponding "_single" routines are available



### B) Runtime options ###
At the moment no runtime options are deprecated. However, future options will only be available via the new
interface
