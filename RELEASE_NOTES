ABI change
---------------------

Since release 2018.05.001 the ABI has changed.

Any incompatibilities to previous version?
---------------------------------------
For Fortran:
Break of ABI compatibility, since all functions obtained an optional, integer
argument of the error code.

For C:
Break of ABI and API compatibility, since all functions obtained a required int* argument of the error code.
