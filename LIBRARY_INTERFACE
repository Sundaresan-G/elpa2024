Libtool interface number history (the "c" in [c:r:a] of
https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html).

- 0
  Legacy interface number for all releases prior to 2014.06

- 1
  Incompatible API change. Most subroutines were converted into functions
  returning a success flag. Previously, the library called exit() on error
  conditions.

  The state of release 2014.06.001 defines this interface

- 2
  Incompatible API change. The routine for ELPA 2 real case takes an
  optional argument, defining whether QR decomposition is used or not

  The state of release 2015.02.001 defines this interface

- 3
  Incompatible API change. C Functions are added to provide an C interface.
  The subroutine "get_elpa_row_col_comms" has been converted to a function
  which returns an error code.

  The state of release 2015.02.002 defines this interface

- 4
  Incompatible API change. The Fortran versions of the library functions return
  a logical indicating success or failure. The C versions of the library functions
  return an integer {0,1} for success and failure.
  Some interface need an extra argument, specifying the number of matrix columns
  (see the documentation)

  The state of release 2015.11.001 defines this interface

- 5
  Compatible API change w.r.t. previous version: Interfaces have been added to unify
  the naming conventions. The old interface are still available

  The states of release 2016.05.001 and 2016.05.002 define this interface

- 6
  Compatible API change w.r.t. previous version: Interfaces have been made public.

  The state of release 2016.05.003 defines this interface

- 7
  Compatible API change w.r.t. previous version: Interfaces for generic driver
  routines have been added. The old interfaces are still available

  The state of release 2016.05.004 defines this interface

- 8
  INCOMPATIBLE API change w.r.t. previous version: Interfaces for single precision
  routines have been added. Additional parameters allow run-time choice of GPU
  version.

  This is an experimental API, which will most likely change in the future

  The state of release 2016.11.001.pre defines this interface

- 9
  NO incompatible API changes w.r.t. the previous version. The interface of
  the previous version 2016.11.001.pre has been marked as "legacy", although it
  is fully available and supported.

  However, a new, more general API has been published, which will in the long run
  completely replace the "legacy" interface.

  The state of release 2017.05.001 defines this interface

- 10
  NO incompatible API changes w.r.t. the previous version. Only some functions have
  been added. The state of release 2017.05.001 defines this interface

- 11
  Incompatible API changes w.r.t. the previous version (only in the so called
  "legacy interface", since as announced some deprecated function aliases have been
  removed). For the current interface all changes since 2017.05.001 are
  compatible, since only some functions have been added. 
  The state of release 2017.11.001.(rc1) defines this interface
